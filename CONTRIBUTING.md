# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in expanding the Lexicon of Nuance! To maintain quality and consistency, please follow this process when suggesting a new word.

## How to Suggest a Word

1. **Open an Issue**
   - Navigate to the [Issues](https://github.com/tharmachodes/lexicon-of-nuance/issues) tab of this repository.
   - Click "New issue".
   - Use the title format: `Suggestion: [Word]` (e.g., `Suggestion: Petrichor`).
   - In the body, provide a brief, one‑sentence explanation of why you find this word evocative or useful.

2. **Discussion**
   - The issue will serve as a discussion thread where others can comment, share related words, or offer additional context.
   - If the word already exists in the lexicon, the issue may be closed with a reference to the existing entry.

3. **Creating an Entry**
   - Once a word is accepted, you (or another contributor) can create a detailed entry.
   - Fork the repository and create a new branch named `add‑word‑[word]`.
   - Add a new Markdown file named `[word].md` in the root directory.
   - Follow the exact entry structure shown below.
   - Submit a pull request, linking to the original issue.

## Entry Structure

Each word entry must be a Markdown file with the following sections:

```markdown
# [Word]

**Pronunciation:** /phonetic transcription/

**Definition:** A clear, concise definition.

**Etymology:** Origin of the word (language roots, historical development).

**Example Usage:** An original, evocative sentence that demonstrates the word in context.
```

## Style Guidelines

- **Definitions** should be accurate and succinct, preferably based on reputable dictionaries.
- **Etymology** should note the language(s) of origin and any interesting historical shifts.
- **Example Usage** must be an original sentence you have written—do not copy from existing sources. Strive for clarity, beauty, and relevance.

## Review Process

All pull requests will be reviewed for accuracy, style, and adherence to these guidelines. Feedback may be given inline, and revisions may be requested before merging.

Happy word‑hunting!
